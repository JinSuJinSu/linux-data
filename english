Na-young, as she prefers to identify herself, is a 12-year-old girl living
in Gyeonggi Province, who faces the threat of deportation when she turns 19.
She is an undocumented child living with her parents from the Philippines,
who entered Korea as migrant workers in the late 1990s, but later lost their legal status.
Undocumented children can only stay in the country until they graduate high school,
after which they face deportation. “She will probably have to go to the Philippines,
which is a completely foreign country for her,” her mother said. Na-young doesn't
know Tagalog, the main language of the Philippines, nor the country's culture.
